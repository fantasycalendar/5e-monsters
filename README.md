# THIS REPOSITORY IS DEPRECATED
Since we decided to completely rewrite Kobold Fight Club, we also decided it should no longer be considered a fork of the original. After all, it doesn't share _any_ of the original code, and only really shares some of the ideas in some of the cases.

As a result, there's a new repository, here: https://github.com/fantasycalendar/kobold-plus-fight-club

This repo will be left up for posterity, but we're not touching it anymore.

# Kobold+ Fight Club
=================
Kobold+ Fight Club is a fork of Kobold Fight Club by Fantasy Computerworks that seeks to address a number of concerns with the original: 
- [x] The project needs new maintainers (Oh hey that's us)
- [x] Need to stop using Google Sheets API as a database+backend
- [ ] Migration method for existing custom content from Google Sheets to another data source (Needs to be as easy to setup and maintain as we can get it)
- [ ] Good way to accept and moderate submissions for new source book creatures
- [ ] Login/sync between devices
- [ ] Update old/outdated versions of various packages
- [ ] Any improvements we can think of!
